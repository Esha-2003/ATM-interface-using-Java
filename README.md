ATM Interface in Java - A Console-Based Banking System
I developed a fully functional ATM Interface in Java, implementing key banking operations like balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, and authentication. This project follows OOP principles and ensures secure user interaction via PIN-based authentication.

Key Features:
âœ” User Authentication â€“ Secure access with PIN verification
âœ” Check Balance â€“ View current account balance
âœ” Deposit Money â€“ Add funds to the account
âœ” Withdraw Money â€“ Withdraw funds with sufficient balance check
âœ” Interactive Console Menu â€“ Simple, user-friendly interface

Tech Stack:
âœ… Java â€“ Core Java, OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction)
âœ… Scanner Class â€“ For user input handling
âœ… Exception Handling â€“ Ensuring smooth operations

Code Snippet:
java

Copy code
ATM myAccount = new ATM(10000, 1234);
System.out.print("Enter PIN: ");
int enteredPin = scanner.nextInt();
if (myAccount.authenticate(enteredPin)) {
    System.out.println("1. Check Balance\n2. Deposit\n3. Withdraw\n4. Exit");
}
